							<p>An award-winning investigative journalist/journalism teacher, communicator, administrator author, activist and financial analyst, Ibim has worked for about 27 years with some of Nigeria’s and America’s leading media outlets. <br> From 2005, to 2007, she worked as Journalism Trainer/Editor with the British Broadcasting Corporation World Service Trust.</p>

<p>She was the first Nigerian female journalist to win the CNN African Journalist of the Year Awards. She won 2nd place, print journalism in the CNN African Journalist Award in 1997 for her reports in the Nigerian print media. She is a two time winner of the Nigerian Media Merit Award and a three time winner of the Diamond Award for Media Excellence amongst several others. This earned Ibim the award-winning journalists mentor role. <br>

<p>Ibim also runs her own publication, The Business Eye, an investigative weekly business newsmagazine.

Ibim Semenitari has a rich resumé in public service having served as the Honourable Commissioner, Ministry of Information and Communications, Rivers State, Nigeria between 2009 and 2015. <br>

Serving in this capacity, at a critical time in Nigeria's democratic history, I, amongst other critical strategic communication initiatives, drafted an open government policy, making Rivers State the first state in Nigeria, to do so.
In 2015, I served as a member of the Communications Directorate, Muhammadu Buhari Presidential Campaign Organisation.</p>

<p>In December 2015, Mrs Semenitari was appointed Ag Managing Director of the Niger Delta Development Commission, an agency responsible for driving development in Nigeria's troubled oil rich region. Her advocacy background and expertise in community engagement, rural development and public service enabled me reposition the Commission, improve transparency and secure significant landmarks in a 10-month stint. No wonder she was quoted as saying "I owe it to my region, to defend it and to develop it”. <br>

Mrs Semenitari, is married to Mr. Henry Semenitari with four children, a former Managing Director, Unity Bank Plc, a global award-winning banker.</p>

<p>Ibim Semenitari is known to be a professional whose work flows from her core values as a Christian, she is committed to the upholding of people’s rights, the sanctity of the family as the primary unit of society and responsible leadership for the community. <br>

A revered woman leader by her community, she is said to be a devoted Christian who teaches during Sunday School at her local Nigerian church.</p>
